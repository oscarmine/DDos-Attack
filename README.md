# üõ°Ô∏è DDoS Attack (Distributed Denial of Service)

A **DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack** is a cyberattack where multiple compromised computers, often part of a **botnet**, flood a target server, network, or website with excessive traffic.  

This overloads the system, making it **slow** or completely **unavailable** to legitimate users.

## üî• How Does a DDoS Attack Work?
1. **Botnet Creation** ‚Äì The attacker infects many devices with malware to control them remotely.  
2. **Traffic Flooding** ‚Äì These compromised devices (bots) send massive amounts of traffic to the target.  
3. **Service Disruption** ‚Äì The target system becomes overwhelmed, leading to downtime or slow performance.  

## üöÄ Common Types of DDoS Attacks
- **üîπ Volumetric Attacks** ‚Äì Overload bandwidth with a flood of data (e.g., UDP flood, ICMP flood).  
- **üîπ Protocol Attacks** ‚Äì Exploit weaknesses in network protocols (e.g., SYN flood, Ping of Death).  
- **üîπ Application Layer Attacks** ‚Äì Target web applications to exhaust server resources (e.g., HTTP flood, Slowloris).  

## üõë How to Prevent DDoS Attacks
‚úÖ Use **firewalls** and **rate limiting**.  
‚úÖ Deploy **CDNs (Content Delivery Networks)** like Cloudflare.  
‚úÖ Implement **DDoS mitigation services**.  
‚úÖ Monitor network traffic for **suspicious spikes**.  

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Stay protected!** DDoS attacks can be devastating, but with the right security measures, you can minimize the risks.
